# article-updates
This is a desktop application, which would notify the user as soon as a research paper or article in one of the user's fields of interest is published. We'll look for the papers on some popular online repositories like [https://arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org). This will be further extended to popular blogs. 

The features and implementation details are yet to decided.

Interested in contribution? Go ahead, contact the mentor, discuss the idea and get started.
